Welcome to the Github repositories for the Cardiac Systems Biology Group. In addition to the repositories hosted within the saucermanlab group, there are repositories hosted by individual lab members. These will be linked below. We hope that you will find our code useful. If you use it, please make sure to appropriately cite both the original manuscript and the code itself, by providing a link to the relevant repository.
